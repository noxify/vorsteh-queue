description: Overview of all Vorsteh Queue packages and their purposes.
---

Vorsteh Queue is built as a modular system with separate packages for different functionality. This allows you to install only what you need and keeps the core lightweight.

## Core Package

- **[@vorsteh-queue/core](/docs/packages/core)** - The main queue engine with all core functionality

## Adapter Packages

- **[@vorsteh-queue/adapter-drizzle](/docs/packages/adapter-drizzle)** - Drizzle ORM adapter for PostgreSQL
- **[@vorsteh-queue/adapter-prisma](/docs/packages/adapter-prisma)** - Prisma ORM adapter for PostgreSQL
- **[@vorsteh-queue/adapter-kysely](/docs/packages/adapter-kysely)** - Kysely adapter for PostgreSQL

## CLI Tools

- **[create-vorsteh-queue](/docs/packages/create-vorsteh-queue)** - CLI tool for creating new projects

## Package Architecture

The modular design allows for:

- **Minimal dependencies** - Only install what you need
- **Flexible adapters** - Easy to add new database adapters
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support across all packages
- **Independent versioning** - Packages can be updated independently

## Installation Patterns

### Basic Setup

```bash
npm install @vorsteh-queue/core @vorsteh-queue/adapter-drizzle
```

### With CLI

```bash
npx create-vorsteh-queue my-app --template=drizzle-postgres
```

Choose the packages that match your project's needs and ORM preference.
