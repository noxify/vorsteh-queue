Vorsteh Queue is a powerful, type-safe queue engine designed for PostgreSQL 12+. It provides a robust solution for handling background jobs, scheduled tasks, and recurring processes in your Node.js applications.

## Key Features

- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with generic job payloads
- **Multiple adapters**: Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL), and in-memory implementations
- **Priority queues**: Numeric priority system (lower = higher priority)
- **Delayed jobs**: Schedule jobs for future execution
- **Recurring jobs**: Cron expressions and interval-based repetition
- **UTC-first timezone support**: Reliable timezone handling with UTC storage
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time job progress updates
- **Event system**: Listen to job lifecycle events
- **Graceful shutdown**: Clean job processing termination

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+**
- **ESM only** - This package is ESM-only and cannot be imported with `require()`
- **PostgreSQL 12+** for production use

## Architecture

Vorsteh Queue follows a modular architecture with:

- **Core package** (`@vorsteh-queue/core`) - Contains the main queue logic and interfaces
- **Adapter packages** - Database-specific implementations (Drizzle, Prisma)
- **UTC-first design** - All timestamps stored as UTC for consistency
- **Event-driven** - Comprehensive event system for monitoring and debugging
