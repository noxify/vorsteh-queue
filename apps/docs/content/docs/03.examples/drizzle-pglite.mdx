description: Lightweight development setup using Drizzle ORM with PGlite for local development and testing.
---

This example shows how to use Vorsteh Queue with Drizzle ORM and PGlite, providing a lightweight PostgreSQL-compatible database that runs entirely in-memory or with local file storage.

## Features Demonstrated

- In-memory PostgreSQL-compatible database
- No external database setup required
- Perfect for development and testing
- Same API as full PostgreSQL setup

## Quick Start

Use the CLI to create this example:

```bash
npx create-vorsteh-queue my-app --template=drizzle-pglite
```

## Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. **Run the example:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

No additional database setup is required - PGlite runs entirely in-memory!

## Benefits of PGlite

- **Zero configuration** - No PostgreSQL installation needed
- **Fast startup** - Instant database initialization
- **Portable** - Works anywhere Node.js runs
- **Compatible** - Full PostgreSQL compatibility
- **Development friendly** - Perfect for local development

## Use Cases

This setup is ideal for:
- Local development
- Testing and CI/CD
- Prototyping
- Demos and examples
- Environments where PostgreSQL installation isn't feasible

## Migration to Production

When ready for production, simply change the database connection from PGlite to a full PostgreSQL instance. The schema and code remain identical.
