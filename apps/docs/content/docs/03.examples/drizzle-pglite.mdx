## Features Demonstrated

- In-memory PostgreSQL-compatible database
- No external database setup required

- Same API as full PostgreSQL setup

## Quick Start

Use the CLI to create this example:

```bash
npx create-vorsteh-queue my-app --template=drizzle-pglite
```

## Configuration

No additional database setup is required - PGlite runs entirely in-memory!

## Usage

# with pnpm
pnpm dev

# with npm
npm run dev
```
