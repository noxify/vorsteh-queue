This example demonstrates how to use job results in Vorsteh Queue. Job handlers can return values that are automatically stored in the database and made available through events and job records.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Result Storage**: Job handlers return results that are automatically stored
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for job payloads and results
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during job processing
- **Error Handling**: Proper error collection and reporting in results
- **Event Access**: Accessing results through job completion events

## Configuration

```bash
# Edit .env with your database URL
cp .env.example .env

# push the schema to the database
pnpm db:push
```

## Usage

```bash
# with pnpm
pnpm dev

# with npm
npm run dev
```
